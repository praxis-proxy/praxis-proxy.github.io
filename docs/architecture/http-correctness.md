# HTTP Correctness

A proxy must enforce HTTP invariants that upstream servers
and downstream clients may not. These are critical
correctness and security concerns.

The Praxis project _strongly_ prefers relying on
[Cloudflare]'s protocol implementations whenever feasible.
Praxis is modular, so it is possible to swap in other
implementations, but Cloudflare has a good track record of
providing correct, hardened and high performance protocol
implementations which are battle-tested with years of
production experience.

- For TCP, we rely on [Pingora]
- For HTTP/1 + HTTP/2, we rely on [Pingora]
- For QUIC + HTTP/3, we rely on [Quiche]

## What Pingora Handles

Pingora 0.8.x handles several correctness concerns at
the framework level:

- **Request smuggling**: Content-Length vs
  Transfer-Encoding validation per
  [RFC 9112](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112).
  Invalid Content-Length headers are rejected. Request
  body draining before connection reuse.
- **Backpressure**: H2 flow control and bounded H1
  channels between upstream reader and downstream writer.
- **Connection pool safety**: connections are only pooled
  when requests complete cleanly. Unconsumed response
  bodies cause the connection to be discarded.

## What Praxis Handles

- **Hop-by-hop headers**: Pingora does not strip
  hop-by-hop headers on the H1-to-H1 path. Praxis
  strips `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`,
  `Transfer-Encoding`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Upgrade`,
  and `Proxy-Authenticate`, plus any custom headers
  declared in the `Connection` header value.
  `Proxy-Authorization` is stripped on the request
  path only (it is request-specific per RFC 9110).
  Stripping is applied on both request
  (`upstream_request_filter`) and response
  (`response_filter`) paths per
  [RFC 9110 Section 7.6.1].
- **Host header validation**: Praxis rejects requests
  with conflicting `Host` headers (400) and
  canonicalizes duplicate identical values. Missing
  `Host` on HTTP/1.1 is rejected per
  [RFC 9112](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112).
- **Proxy headers**: Pingora adds no `X-Forwarded-For`,
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`, or similar headers. Praxis
  injects these with configurable trust boundaries
  via the `forwarded_headers` filter.
- **Reserved internal headers**: Praxis uses
  `x-praxis-*`, `x-mcp-*`, and `x-a2a-*` prefixes
  for proxy-internal routing metadata (e.g.
  body-derived fields promoted to headers). These are
  rejected from client requests (400), stripped before
  forwarding to backends, and stripped from backend
  responses before reaching clients.
- **Retry safety**: retries must only apply to idempotent
  requests where no bytes have been written upstream.
